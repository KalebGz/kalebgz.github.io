        <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/FuzzMe" target="_blank">Fuzzme</a></li>
            <p>
              Fuzzme is a web app designed to protect your privacy by flooding the
internet with images that spread false information about you. By flooding the internet
with enough false information, it will become impossible to distinguish fact from reality.
Your name can no longer be tainted online because we will taint it according to your
choosing first! At FuzzMe, we think of anonymity not as its Greek translation “no name”,
but rather “so many names that you might as well have none”.

            <p>
              Catfish is a CLI application that uses OpenAI’s language model to create
streamlined requests for text data. Catfish also allows the user to upload any image into
a specified directory and when its filename is entered in the similar images feature, it
automatically generates, saves and opens a file that is a significantly altered yet similar
version of the inputted image.
            </p>
          </ul>


          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/Skate_NH" target="_blank">Skate New Haven Website</a></li>
            <p>
              skate-nhv.com was a website for a newsletter that attempts to explore and
evaluate different skate spots around New Haven.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              Dayveloper is a web app that uses widget-like modules to create a hub for
recurring google searches like the weather while also acting as a space to build routines
like a widget designed for improving one’s vocabulary.

            <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/Workout-Manager" target="_blank">Workout manager</a></li>
            <p>
              This is a web app designed to organize and track workouts that I built with a
partner for the Flatiron Full stack web development class.
            </p>
          </ul>


          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/Sleep-Safe" target="_blank">Sleep safe</a></li>
            <p>
              Sleep Safe is a product designed to actively measure the noise near spaces
where someone is sleeping. It is a device that can be set to a predefined threshold for
the noise level that would be considered tolerable. Should the noise level exceed this
threshold, Sleep Safe sends Bluetooth signals to a node device placed in an area near
the source of the noise which illuminates an LED fixture to indicate a warning for noise
exceeding the defined threshold. The device also has the functionality to allow the user
to override the algorithm and manually trigger the noise level indicator.
            </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/CLI-Checkers" target="_blank">Cli-Checkers</a></li>
            <p>
              A multiplayer checkers game built using ruby that is played on a command line interface.

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://devpost.com/software/bituminous-sand-detecting-rover" target="_blank">Hackathon Oil Detecting Rover</a> </li>
            <p>
              This was another hackathon project where we wrote code that would rank
              the contamination level of different beaches using camera feed data from an
              autonomous rover.
            </p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/Mario" target="_blank">StdDraw Mario</a> </li>
            <p>
              This was a group hackathon project that used Java’s standard draw library to generate the first level of Super Mario Bros.
            </p>
          </ul>

              <br>
              This was a final group project for Professor Vásquez’s class Building Interactive Machines. We used reinforcement learning to teach the robot shutter how to play Zip Zap Boing with 2 human players.
            </p>
          </ul>


          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/KalebGz/Zombie-world" target="_blank"> Youbot Zoombie Apocolypse Robot Architecture </a></li>
            <p>
              We built an intricate finite state machine robot architecture in the webots robot
              simulator that drives a rover that uses various sensors. The integration of lidar data and a color
              camera feed allowed us to autonomously control a robot to collect simulated resources in an
              environment with simulated zombies that it tries to avoid.
            </p>
          </ul>
